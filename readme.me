# Perfect Excerpt
Perfect Excerpt is a WordPress plugin that shortens your excerpts to whole sentences. It will break the text on the punctuation closest to the length specified. Set the excerpt length by adding the row below to functions.php.

```
update_option('excerpt_length', 300);
```
The number 300 in this case is the maximum number of words that will be shown.

Happy blogging!
